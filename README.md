# UKBB Genetic Architecture
The genetic architecture of complex traits and its relevance to polygenic score performance
 
## Contents

- `code_part1/`: contains scripts that lead to the creation of the traits table that contains all trait-relevant information. Also contains small input data created by us that is needed.

- `other_data/`: placeholder directory for non-Prive et al. data needed as input (e.g. genetic recombination map)
- `generated_data/`: contains data generated by scripts in this repository
- `generated_figures/`: contains figures generated by scripts in this repository
